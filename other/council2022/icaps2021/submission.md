## Notes
1. The breakdown of desk rejects by nation suggests there may be issues with our explanation of the submission requirements, due to language, unfamiliarity with the ICAPS community (in particular where Relevance is concerned), or some combination of these.
2. Desk rejections due to exceeding the length restrictions in some cases seem to be related to confusion about the 4+1 / 8+1 length specification. Is the +1 only for citations (and should the citations be pushed to a separate page in all cases), or can the text share the final page? Our Requirements should be clarified, taking into account the fact that authors may not read the requirements end to end and with sufficient care.
