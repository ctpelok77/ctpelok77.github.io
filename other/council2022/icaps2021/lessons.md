## Easychair
* Single-track option is more hassle than good. 
* Reviewers declaring conflicts after assignment are quietly removed.
* Emails: Authors'/PC emails in easychair are not verified
* No option in Easychair to have an individual workload constraint for a PC member, kept externally. 
* Black lists should be kept updated, including reasons. Trust the reviewer black list!

## Desk Rejects
* Should we revisit the notion of desk-rejecting any paper that gets no bids at all?  
* There is no desk-reject plugin yet, although we were told they are working on it. 
* Define different flavors of desk reject for different rationales. Helpful for accountability, statistics.
<!-- Note that the papers for which decisions have already been made still appear everywhere and should be manually excluded from assignment, etc. -->


## Reviewing Practices
* Especially in years with special tracks, we should probably add a “relevance” item to the reviewing form.
* Helpful: have example positive and negative reviews. We have relied on informal expectation-setting and as the community grows this may no longer be tenable.
* Add a separate mandatory field for questions to reviewers.
* Larger time gap between reviewing deadline and author feedback. We need some sort of a mechanism to monitor reviewing progress.
* We need better instructions on what counts as (self)plagiarism. For instance, do we consider background to be free of the claim of plagiarism?  Some reviewers thought it was plagiarism to lift the notation definitions completely from a previous paper of one’s own.  On the one hand, this seems fine -- tweaking the wording is a waste of time for everyone -- but on the other hand, given the notionally anonymous nature of the submissions, it’s hard to tell “real” plagiarism from self plagiarism.


## Ethics
* We should consider adding a request to consider the ethical implications of the work to our calls for papers, along the lines of those done by other conferences.
* We should consider adding an ethical statement to the proceedings. Note that this can run afoul of AAAI Press wanting to be the ones to write the front-matter (see below)!

## AAAI Press Publishers
All of the following are necessary because of actions that AAAI Press took without consultation and that they declined to modify.
* Modify the contract so that they must consult us before publishing, because they didn’t and after publishing they say it’s too late to make changes.
* Modify the contract to say that the volume summary is to be composed with the conference chairs’ input. See note about Ethics statement above.
* Modify the contract to say that the cover layout is to be designed in conjunction with the conference chairs, and not finalized without their approval.
* The cost estimate we got from AAAI Press was for only 40 papers.  We should ask for an estimate based on a more realistic number of papers from whoever is our publisher in the future.

## Awards
* Titles of the awards have not been consistent.  

## Session/tracks organization
* Identify target dates for issuing calls/inviting speakers. Conference chair should track the timeline for all of the sessions and ensure that the calls go out (did not happen in time with tutorials)

## Website Design
* In online conferences, website design is a huge and time consuming effort: conference chairs need to allocate adequate resources.
